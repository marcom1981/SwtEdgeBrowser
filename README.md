# SwtEdgeBrowser
Drop in replace SWT browser implementation for support Edge WebView2 Control.

The current version requires Edge Canary to be installed.

The current version is based on SWT 4.7 and is still in the ALFA phase.

The goal is to create a library that can use Windows Edge Chromium, Edge html and if it is not installed, automatically use the original SWT browser.
