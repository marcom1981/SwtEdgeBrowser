# SwtEdgeBrowser
Drop in replace SWT browser implementation for support Edge WebView2 Control.

This is a derived work of Serge Zaitsev WebView https://github.com/zserge/webview

The current version requires Edge Canary to be work.

The current version is based on SWT 4.7 and is still in the ALFA phase.

The goal is to create a library that can use Windows Edge Chromium, Edge html and if it is not installed, automatically use the original SWT browser.
